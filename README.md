# html-registration
Registration page with HTML and Css only.
Anyone can modify it to add their favorites back-end code.
Anyone can use this and adapt it to serve their project.
You can find the same registration page in another repository of mine with html, Css and PHP, so you can add your own server side language.
Another repository of mine will have the same registration page with PHP and MySQL code added.
